Faced with an unknown illness plaguing the Kujo household's mother, her dutiful son Jotaro embarks on a mission to find and kill the supposed perpetrator - the nemesis of the Joestar lineage, Dio.
He uses his newly awakened ability, a STAND that he names Star Platinum, and makes friends and foes on his way. The first of which is none other than Kakyoin.
(I do not remember much about this season).
